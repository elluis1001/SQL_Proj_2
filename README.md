# SQL_Proj_2

In this project I created mock table of patients with SQL Server Management Studio, and then added 100 more patients to the table.

The table contains the following columns:
-PatientID int
-First_Name 
-Last_Name
-Gender
-Age
-Insurance

I created another table with the same mock patients but for patient results:
-PatientID
-First_Name
-Last_Name
-Glucose
-bmi
-HgA1c

I had the help of AI to help create the mock patients for the data.
